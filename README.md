# Web Scraping and Crawling Project

This repository contains a project focused on web scraping and web crawling using the website [Turismo.gov.br - Agenda de Eventos](https://www.turismo.gov.br/agenda-eventos/views/calendario.php). The project demonstrates the process of extracting data from web pages, storing it in a database, and performing queries on that data.

## Project Structure

- **TP5.py**: Python script for web scraping. This script extracts data from the specified website and saves it into the `dbEventos.db` SQLite database.
- **Queries.py**: Python script for querying the data stored in the SQLite database. This script allows you to run various queries to analyze the scraped data.
- **dbEventos.db**: SQLite database file that stores the data extracted from the website by `TP5.py`.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts event data from the Turismo.gov.br website and stores it in a database.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the extracted data into an SQLite database for structured storage.
- **Data Analysis**: Allows querying and analysis of the stored data using Python.
